## About GeniSys AI

GeniSys AI is an open source Artificial Intelligence Assistant Network using Computer Vision, Natural Linguistics and the Internet of Things. GeniSys uses a system based on [TASS A.I](https://github.com/TASS-AI/TASS-Facenet "TASS A.I") for [vision](https://github.com/GeniSysAI/Vision "vision"), an [NLU engine](https://github.com/GeniSysAI/NLU "NLU engine") for natural language understanding, in browser speech synthesis and speech recognition for speech and hearing, all homed on a dedicated Linux server in your home and managed via an online operating system.

## About GeniSys AI Server
[![GeniSys AI Server](images/GeniSysHome.jpg)](https://github.com/GeniSysAI/Server)

[GeniSys AI Server](https://github.com/GeniSysAI/Server "GeniSys AI Server") is a customisable management system for [GeniSys AI](https://github.com/GeniSysAI/Server "GeniSys AI") networks. The GeniSys management system is built on top of [Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ "Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)"), but there should be no issues using other Linux operating systems. The server uses a secure PHP/MySql NGINX server, [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/ "Let’s Encrypt") for free SSL encryption, and free IoT connectivity via the [iotJumpWay](https://www.iotJumpWay.tech "iotJumpWay").

# What Will We Do?

This tutorial will help you setup the server required for your GeniSys network, and also takes you through setting up iotJumpWay devices and applications. In detail this guide will cover the following:

- Installation: Ubuntu 18.04, NGINX, Let's Encrypt, PHP, MySql, phpMyAdmin, IP tables
- Setup: Domain name & DNS configuration, router port forwarding, IP tables security, Device Proxy
